GOsa2.1 README
==============

* Information

GOsa is a LDAP administration frontend for user administration. It
is NO GENERIC frontend to dictionary servers. Informations are stored
in the way the underlying conecpts suppose them to be stored (i.e.
people accounts are stored in "ou=people" subtrees, etc.) This can
be configured marginally.

Complete setups applying Kerberos, AFS, LDAP, Mail, Proxy and Fax setups
are not trivial at all. You should be familiar with these components and
with your UNIX installation, of cause. This file is (and will not be)
an introduction to any of these components. See INSTALL for a quick
overview about what to do, to get the things up and running. A complete
GOsa infrastructure howto is work in progress and not released yet.


* Translations

GOsa is not available in your native language? Just take the message.po
file out of the locales directory and put your translations into the
msgstr fields. You may look at the de/LC_MESSAGES for the way how it
works.

If you're ready with that, create a directory for your language using
the ISO shortcuts (i.e. es for spain) with a subdirectory LC_MESSAGES.
Put your messages.po in there and run "msgfmt messages.po" from that
directory. Make sure your apache has locale support or, in case of debian,
that the specific locale will be generated (via dpkg-reconfigure locales).

You may want your translations to be included in the main GOsa repository,
then just send the .po file to me.


* NOTES

You'll need php-cups (http://www.cups.org) and php-krb5 (pear) in order
to get full functionality. To make shared folders work in a proper way,
you either need a recent PHP or a patched one for the get_acl functions
(see contrib/patches). Basically GOsa will run without these.

Be sure that 'gosaUserTemplates' are not able to log into your server,
since they may have no password set. Example configs can be found in
the contrib directory.

Have fun!
