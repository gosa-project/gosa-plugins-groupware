README.Debian for GOsa 2.5
--------------------------

* Configure GOsa

By default you can point your favorite browser to the GOsa setup by
using this URL:

http://you.server.address/gosa

Follow the instructions on the screen.


* Generic informations

Getting GOsa running itself is not very complicated. Problems normally
arise when integrating it in various services.

To play nice with your LDAP, you need to include the gosa schema files
into your LDAP configuration. For Debian, you should install the
gosa-schema package and add at least the following lines to your
LDAP-servers slapd.conf:

Samba 2:
include         /etc/ldap/schema/samba.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/trust.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/gosystem.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/gofon.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/goto.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/gosa.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/gofax.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/goserver.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/goto-mime.schema

Samba 3:
include         /etc/ldap/schema/samba3.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/trust.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/gosystem.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/gofon.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/goto.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/gosa+samba3.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/gofax.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/goserver.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/goto-mime.schema

Schema files for samba and trust accounts are not part of the
gosa-schema package, but are included in:

/usr/share/doc/gosa/contrib/openldap

There's no need to have samba services up and running, GOsa only
uses the NT/LM attributes to pre-generate samba password hashes -
to allow easy switching of account properties without asking for
passwords after adding samba accounts.


* Smarty PHP errors

There might pop up messages about "Only variables should be passed by
reference" when using PHP5. I can't do anything about them - these are
cause by smarty. To get rid of them set your "error_reporting" in the
php.ini to "E_ALL ^ E_NOTICE". This is a workaround only, wait for the
debian smarty package to support PHP5 in a propper way.
